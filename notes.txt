Outline:
-cmd line tool
-take master pass and show entries
-automatically copy pass to clipboard
-generate random pass

Implementation:

-Configure:
  -MASTER PASSWORD input while configuring, hash of it stored in a file
  -SALT/DEVICE SECRET generated randomly, stored in a file
  -MASTER PASS + SALT passed to hashing function to create the MASTER KEY, used for AES256 encryption
  -MASTER KEY used to encrypt/decrypt passwords
  -encrypted fields - uname, pass, email
  -plain fields - site name, url

-Adding new entry:
  -get MASTER PASS
  -hash it to see if it matches available hash
  -combine with SALT, get MASTER KEY
  -use it to encrypt the fields, store it in a DB
  -also imp to see if all req entries available

-Get entry:
  -input the field to search for
  -show all matching with password hidden (ofc)
  -if user wants to get pass:
  	-ask for MASTER PASS
  	-validate, combine with SALT, and decrypt using MASTER KEY
  	-copy to clipboard
